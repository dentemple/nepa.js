## Add more tests (unit, integration, e2e, etc....)

This project uses [`jest`] (https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [`enzyme`](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) for testing.

This project uses a [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) pipeline; therefore, tests are the lifeblood to ensure that bugs don't fall through the cracks.
