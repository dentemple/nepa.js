## Technology

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (CRA).

CRA provides [a very thorough user guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) for performing common tasks.

## Additional libraries that have been added

### Collaboration Tools

Auto-formats your code on commit:

- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) - "Because friends don't let friends argue about semicolons"

### Project Dependencies

Syntatic sugar for a feature that's new to React v16:

- [react-aux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-aux)

A CSS-in-JS alternative (CRA already works with CSS modules out-of-the-box)

- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)

## Continuous Integration

Changes to `master` will be deployed automatically to a live dev environment.
